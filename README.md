This project is an attempt to bridge the gap between farm output and processors or customers of the produce. Stakeholders such as the primary producers (farmers), processors who use Moringa as raw materials, and the final consumers, are all brought together into one platform, where they can interract without the bottleneck of middlemen or offtakers. This will greatly improve the farmers' profitability.
